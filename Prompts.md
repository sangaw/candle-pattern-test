# Initialization Prompts

Please familirize yourself with the code and comments. We will do further enhancements today.

How to generate access token using the python code. Please provide the command to run

python src/auth/get_request_token.py
# (Follow browser steps, copy request token)

python src/auth/token_generator.py
# (Follow prompts to generate and save access token)

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process RemoteSigned

   cd candle-pattern-test
   python -m venv myenv
   myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r ..\requirements.txt
   ```

   Or install kiteconnect specifically:
   ```bash
   pip install kiteconnect>=4.2.0
   ```

3. **Alternative: Install all dependencies at once**:
   ```bash
   pip install requests pandas numpy kiteconnect matplotlib seaborn pytest pytest-cov pytest-mock black flake8 mypy python-dateutil python-dotenv pydantic pydantic-ai ta scikit-learn
   ```

The error occurs because the `kiteconnect` package (which is used for Zerodha Kite API integration) is not installed in your current Python environment. Once you install it using one of the methods above, the import error should be resolved.

Would you like me to help you with anything else related to this project, or do you have any questions about the installation process?
