# Machine Learning Approach: Clustering NIFTY Data

## Overview

Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar data points together. For NIFTY data, clustering can help identify periods with similar price movements, volatility regimes, or market behaviors.

## Typical Steps

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Fetch historical NIFTY OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data.
   - Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, normalize features).

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create features such as daily returns, volatility, moving averages, or technical indicators.
   - Optionally, use dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) to reduce feature space.

3. **Clustering Algorithm**
   - Common algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering.
   - Choose the number of clusters (for K-Means) using the elbow method or silhouette score.

4. **Model Training**
   - Fit the clustering algorithm to the feature matrix.
   - Assign each day (or period) to a cluster.

5. **Analysis & Visualization**
   - Visualize clusters on a 2D plot (e.g., using PCA or t-SNE).
   - Analyze the characteristics of each cluster (e.g., average return, volatility).
   - Overlay cluster labels on price charts to interpret market regimes.

## Example: K-Means on NIFTY Returns

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load NIFTY data
# (Assume the CSV has columns: date, open, high, low, close, volume)
df = pd.read_csv('data/NIFTY_2025.csv')
df['return'] = df['close'].pct_change()
df = df.dropna()

# Feature matrix
X = df[['return']].values
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# K-Means clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
df['cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)

# Visualize clusters
plt.scatter(df.index, df['return'], c=df['cluster'])
plt.title('NIFTY Daily Returns Clustering')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Return')
plt.show()
```

## Interpretation

- Each cluster represents a group of days with similar return characteristics.
- You can analyze the average return and volatility for each cluster to understand different market regimes (e.g., trending, volatile, or calm periods).
