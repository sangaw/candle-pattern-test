**Sectoral View Summary by Avadhut Sathe using Tabela Scanner:**

- Avadhut Sir utilized the *Tabela Scanner* to provide a comprehensive sectoral analysis of the Indian stock market during Muhurat Trading.
- **Market Overview:** He examined key indices like Nifty and Bank Nifty, noting their approach toward new all-time highs and recent breakout patterns. He emphasized that early Diwali trades often see gaps and volatility, cautioning viewers against impulsive decisions on symbolic trading days.
- **Sector Performance Highlights:**
  - **Banking Sector:** Bank Nifty is performing strongly with recent breakouts. Stocks like SBI, Canara Bank, and Bank of Baroda are near all-time highs. RBL Bank and Yes Bank also showed promising setups, but Avadhut Sir advised focusing on outperforming stocks with strong momentum.
  - **Metals:** The metal index is near all-time highs. Stocks like JSW Steel and Hindustan Copper are identified as outperformers when the sector rises.
  - **Pharma:** Pharma sector demonstrated breakout potential, with stocks like Sun Pharma, Granules, and Divi’s Lab highlighted for their positive price movements and proximity to 52-week highs.
  - **Auto:** The auto sector is also displaying strong patterns and is near high levels.
  - **FMCG and IT:** These sectors are currently underperforming, with sideways trends and limited breakout potential.
  - **Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs):** After historic outperformance, these stocks are currently lagging. Focus should be on sectors and stocks showing technical strength.
- **Approach with Tabela Scanner:** Avadhut Sir stressed the importance of thorough study and patience—using scanner results to identify *outperforming sectors* and *stocks with strong breakouts*, rather than jumping into trades blindly. Technical setups such as higher lows, sector rotations, and confirmed resistance breaks are key filters on the Tabela Scanner.
- **Final Notes:** Avadhut Sathe advised to concentrate on sectors with robust technical charts and clear breakout signals (Banking, Metals, Pharma, and select Auto)—avoiding overtraded or weak sectors until they improve. He recommended entering trades only after confirmation from reliable scanner data and price action, maintaining discipline and a study-driven approach throughout Muhurat Trading.[1]

This sectoral summary encapsulates Avadhut Sir’s methodical, scanner-based market view and his advice for trading safely and effectively on auspicious days.
